# Clean-Sort-Transactions

- This algorithm will filter out duplicate transactions within a 1 minute time frame.
- The list of transactions are sourced from the transactions.json file within the directory.
- You can try out different scenarios by adding or removing transactions in the transactions.json file, such as having a lone orphan transaction with a time somewhere in the middle of the other duplicates.
- run `npm install` on the first time you clone this repository.
- run `node app.js` or `npm start` to run the algorithm.
